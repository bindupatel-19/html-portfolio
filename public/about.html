<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>My name is Bindu Patel and I live in Banglore and I'm currently pursuing B.Tech in aerospace in Alliance University. I love dancing,
   singing(fan of k-pop), cooking, adventuring and above all of that spirituality is something I'm deeply interested in and I'm a devout follower of my DEVI. </p>

<p>As a child I always dreamt of being a software developper but as I grew up I got influenced by space, star and spacecraft.
   I really wanted to know the science behind them. So I took aeospace engineering and now I'm currently in 6th semester. 
   And I'm very much passionate about learning new things. Recently I got interest towards web development so started learning it.
   And this is my first basic project of portfolio website. I hope I'll ace the course and will definetly learn and explore new things in life.</p>
 <p>Thank you for coming here!!</p>
